# Curvetopia

Welcome to Curvetopia, a robust tool designed to identify, regularize, and beautify various types of curves in 2D Euclidean space. This project is tailored for graphic designers, animators, and developers who work with digital graphics and require precise curve manipulations.

## Project Overview

Curvetopia is built to handle a wide range of curve processing tasks such as smoothing, symmetrization, and completion of incomplete curves. By leveraging advanced algorithms in computational geometry and machine learning, Curvetopia enhances the usability and aesthetics of digital curves.

## Features

- **Curve Regularization**: Smoothens and refines curves to remove noise and irregularities, providing cleaner and more visually appealing outputs.
- **Symmetry Detection**: Automatically detects and enforces symmetrical properties in shapes, which is crucial for balanced and aesthetically pleasing designs.
- **Occlusion Handling**: Capable of reconstructing obscured or missing parts of curves, making it invaluable for restoring incomplete digital artworks.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Includes tools to visualize the curves before and after processing, allowing for immediate feedback and adjustments.
